## Description

🎮 Discord Rich Presence Customizer is a TypeScript-based project that allows you to customize your Discord Rich Presence status. This guide will help you set up the project easily, even if you have no technical background.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Latest version of Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

1. **Discord Developer Portal 🖥️**
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in to your Discord account.
   - Create a new application with a name of your choice, which will be displayed as your profile's activities.
   - Copy the **Client ID** from the **OAuth2** section inside the developer portal.

2. **Environment Variables ⚙️**
   - In the main project directory, create a new file called `.env` by referencing the provided `.example.env` file.
   - Replace the placeholder value for `CLIENT_ID` with the copied **Client ID**.

3. **Configuration 🛠️**
   - Open the `config.js` file located in the main project directory.
   - Edit the configuration options based on what you want to display on your Discord profile.

4. **Adding Images 🖼️**

   - In your application's settings, navigate to the **Rich Presence** tab and scroll down to the bottom.
   - Click on the **Add Image** button to upload the images you want to display on your Rich Presence.
   - Ensure you name the images properly, as the image name will be used as the `ImageKey` inside the config file.
